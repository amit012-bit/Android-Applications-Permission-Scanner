# Android-Applications-Permission-Scanner
A privacy-focused Android app scanner developed in Java on Android Studio. This tool scans all installed applications to detect if any are accessing your device's camera or microphone. When such activity is found, it prompts you to use the app briefly, allowing it to monitor for potential privacy issues and alert you if any concerns arise.
